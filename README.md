# ClariQ 1.0.0
So here it is. The first "Final" release version of ClariQ, the successor to the Nvexx Audyssey Optimization Tool

# What's new?
* More precisions
  * The script has been updated for better and more precise calculations including:
    * delay calculations
    * distance calculations
    * speed of sound calculations
    * subwoofer alignment
  * Greatly enhanced Subwoofer and Multi-sub calculations and alignment no matter how many subwoofers you have.
 
# Updated interface
  * Updated step by step interface for easy use and guidance.
  * Updated and real time feedback on the page. See what is happening and what the script is asking from you (less looking at the log during setup)
  * Color coded - Red/Orange/green (makes it simpler to understand)

# Complete control
  * Find the perfect settings for your setup.
  * Set the start and end Frequency filter values for each speaker(pair)
  * Set a single or ranged Frequency for each speaker(pair)
  * Set the Max Boost for each speaker(pair)

# Separate target curves
  * The script now supports having separate target curves for each individual speaker and speaker(pair)
  * The script now supports having separate target curves for the speakers and the subwoofer. A baseline flat-curve is also included.

# Runs locally (on your pc)
  * Download the script and run it

# Saves settings
   * The settings from your last run get saved. this makes it easier to run the script and not having to enter all the settings again for follow up runs (finding your perfect settings will take several runs most of the time).

# What still needs to be done?
  * Documentation / FAQ
    * still need to add documentation. 1.0.0 will be used as starting point.
  * Modal pop-ups (?) still working on updating and adding new ones. (haven't looked at them for quite some time)
  * Default values / Selections. I can only test so much and feedback would help a lot on this topic.
